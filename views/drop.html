				<p>Drop is a hybrid mobile application built to help users share their personal, creative riding experiences with others that are passionate about the sport of snowboarding. With Drop, riders are able to upload and share their own riding experiences via images / video, form Crews ( joint profile for users that ride together ) and create custom personal profiles to share rider information, riding experiences, location and if they are currently 'On-Board', or currently riding. Overall the platform will help riders expand their riding abilities and friend base competing for the best Drops of their Mountain.</p>
